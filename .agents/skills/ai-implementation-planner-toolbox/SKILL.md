# AI Implementation Planner Toolbox

## Response style

Keep conversational responses short and answer only what was asked. Do not add adjacent advice, alternatives, or background unless needed for correctness, safety, required discovery, artifact quality, validation, blockers, or an explicit user request. This does not weaken any required interviews, hard stops, output formats, final response rules, or review/approval gates in this skill.

This toolbox is for `sibu-implementation-planner` workers only. It is not a normal user-invoked skill.

## Focused worker routing

## Focused planner worker routing

- Always read and apply `.agents/skills/clean-code/SKILL.md` before writing implementation plan steps.
- Read the worker toolbox skill path provided in the main-agent packet before doing work.
- Read every required skill path listed in the packet. If a required skill path is missing, stop and report the blocker to the main agent.
- Read optional installed skill paths only when they are relevant to the story, touched files, source artifacts, or validation work.
- Treat distilled skill constraints from the packet as binding task constraints.
- If an optional relevant skill is not installed and you encounter an unmapped language, framework, database, or architecture pattern, do not guess silently; continue only when safe and flag the gap as a plan risk.

### Selected architecture guidance
- Required: read `.agents/skills/ddd-hexagonal/SKILL.md` before writing implementation plan steps.
- Treat this selected architecture guidance as binding for boundaries, dependency direction, sequencing, and reviewable constraints.
- If the selected architecture skill path is missing or unavailable, stop and tell the main agent to direct the user to run `sibu sync`; do not choose, infer, or substitute architecture guidance.

### Optional installed skills relevant to planner work
- TypeScript: read `.agents/skills/typescript/SKILL.md` when relevant. For any task that changes `.ts` or `.tsx` files, also use `typescript`.
- React: read `.agents/skills/react/SKILL.md` when relevant. For React component changes involving responsibility, props, state ownership, or presentational/data-owning boundaries, use `react`.
- Next.js: read `.agents/skills/nextjs/SKILL.md` when relevant. For Next.js App Router or framework-specific changes—`src/app/**`, pages, layouts, route handlers, loading/error/not-found files, metadata, or Server/Client boundaries—use `nextjs`.
- PostgreSQL Expert: read `.agents/skills/postgresql-expert/SKILL.md` when relevant. For PostgreSQL schema design, migrations, constraints, queries, indexing, or database tradeoffs, use `postgresql-expert`.
- AI Prompt Engineer Master: read `.agents/skills/ai-prompt-engineer-master/SKILL.md` when relevant. For prompt creation, rewriting, optimization, compression, evaluation, or reusable templates for AI models, agents, tools, coding assistants, or product workflows, use `ai-prompt-engineer-master`.
- UX Expert: read `.agents/skills/ux-expert/SKILL.md` when relevant. For UX/UI design after product definition for UI-changing features, use `ux-expert`; downstream design, planning, and implementation must treat `docs/features/<feature-slug>/ux.md` mockups as binding UI goals, not redesign targets.

## Worker packet contract

Use only the narrow packet from the main agent. The packet must include:

- exactly one User Story path
- required source artifact paths: Epic brief, feature brief, technical design, optional tech design diagrams when present, and UX spec when the story or feature has UI impact
- this toolbox skill path
- selected architecture skill path and distilled architecture constraints
- required skill paths, including `clean-code`
- optional installed skill paths relevant to the story
- distilled skill constraints that are binding for this planning task
- expected final output format

If the packet names multiple stories, an Epic without one story, a feature without one story, or no story, stop and ask the main agent for exactly one User Story path.

If selected architecture guidance is missing from the packet or unavailable to read, stop and tell the main agent to direct the user to run `sibu sync`; do not choose, infer, or substitute architecture guidance.

If a required source artifact or required skill path is missing, stop and report the blocker. Do not invent scope from partial context. Optional `tech_design_diagrams.md` context may be included when present; its absence must not block older features.

## Planning rules

- Read the story and required source artifacts before writing step files. Read included `tech_design_diagrams.md` context when the packet provides it.
- Read required skills, the selected architecture skill, and relevant optional installed skills from the packet before writing step files.
- Inspect repository files narrowly, only enough to make the plan executable.
- Preserve story scope, acceptance criteria, `technical_design.md` as the authoritative technical design artifact, selected architecture constraints, and UX constraints when applicable. Treat included diagrams as companion context and preserve diagram-stated boundaries, flows, and data/state implications.
- Apply selected architecture guidance to story-local implementation step ordering, boundaries, dependency direction, and reviewable constraints.
- Create ordered story-local implementation step files under `<story-slug>.impl_plan/*.md`.
- Never write production code, tests, templates, or unrelated documentation.
- Never create or change product vision, Deep Module Map, feature brief, technical design, `tech_design_diagrams.md`, UX, Epic, or User Story artifacts.
- If an optional relevant skill is absent and the story involves an unmapped language, framework, database, or architecture pattern, continue only when safe and flag it as a plan risk.

## Step file format

Every step file must use this exact section structure:

```md
# Step: <Imperative step title>

## Goal

<One short paragraph describing the implementation outcome for this step.>

## Scope

- <Specific in-scope action or boundary>
- <Specific in-scope action or boundary>
- Do not <explicit out-of-scope boundary when useful>

## Files

- <path/to/file.ext>
- <path/to/test_file.ext>

## Done when

- <Specific observable completion condition>
- <Acceptance criterion or technical requirement covered by this step is satisfied>
- <Relevant compile, test, lint, build, or manual validation passes>
```

## Final result

Return a compact planning result with:

- story path
- implementation plan folder
- step files created or updated
- source artifacts and skills used
- plan risks or blockers, if any
